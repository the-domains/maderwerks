Rivalry Games - A Father/Son Tradition

November- 2007 Army/Navy Game

If you are looking for tradition, you don't have to go much farther than the great tradition of the annual Army vs. Navy game.  This is a game that pits two storied branches of the Armed Forces against each other where bragging rights and honor are the outcomes far more important than the score or Coache's Poll rankings that year.  This is a game where all levels from civies (like us) midshipmen, cadets all the way up to admirals and generals want to get that elusive ticket to.  Let's put this in perspective, the Secretary of Defense brings in the game ball!  (He spends one half on each sideline to show equal support; the SECNAV and SECARM are not quite as unbiased!)

We were lucky enough to get tickets to this game and it is an experience neither of us will forget again not for the football (which was actually pretty bad) but all the moments and experiences of the day that made this game like no other in college sports.
